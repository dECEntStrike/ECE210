# ECE210
Select Coursework from UIUC ECE210

I will be posting various assignments from UIUC's ECE210 course. It is notoriously difficult, with brutal grading, and is also very time consuming. You are free to use these as reference, but please do not plagiarize. Not only will you get in trouble, but the school will likely get the repo taken down. And if you are a staff member, please understand. If you need specific problems taken down, maybe because they are too similar to upcoming exam problems, please try to contact me.
